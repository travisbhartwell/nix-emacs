#+TITLE: Nix Options
A set of useful Emacs modes and functions for users of Nix and Nix OS.

** Usage

*** helm-nixos-options

The function =helm-nixos-options= is the one that you want to bind. You are free
to choose where and if you want it global you can have this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-S-n") 'helm-nixos-options)
#+end_src

It looks like this

The description of the option is shown in the minibuffer

If you want more information, there is a detailed buffer when you press =return=

There are also other actions like inserting the current match into the buffer

Add company-nixos-options to allowed company-mode backends list

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-nixos-options)
#+end_src

For now it shows the documentation of the option in a popup-buffer.
